<p>Automakers could benefit from a tool to predict the starting value of a newly created car based on the features of the car. The objective of this car data
analysis is to collect and build multiple linear regression models to predict car price. The goal of the analysis is to reduce the error associated with the cost function as much as possible to produce the most effective regression model for prediction. The data was scraped from car-data.com and prepoccesed before regression models were fit. Multicollinearity and homoscedasticity were seen in the data and were attempted to be counteracted. A ridge regression model was found to have the highest accuracy of predicting the true car price. The results showed that the price of a car, the target variable, had a strong linear relationship with the horsepower of the engine. Other key features are torque, engine capacity and acceleration. The model had the highest accuracy when predicting car prices on the lower to mid range of the price scale. There are fewer data points for high values cars in the dataset leading to more unstable predictions.</p>
