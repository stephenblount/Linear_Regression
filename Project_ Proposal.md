### Project Proposal: Linear Regression Analysis

The purpose of the analysis is to create a linear regression model that will predict the miles per gallon (MPG) an automobile can drive based on features the automobile possesses. The benefit of this model would be to predict MPG of automobiles where that information is unknown and to investigate if there are key features that influence MPG greater than others. The data will be scrapped from [Ultimate Specs](https://www.ultimatespecs.com). This data will be comprised of: name, engine size, engine type, curb weight, body style, number of doors, length, height, width, wheelbase, MPG, top speed, acceleration, and year. The target to predict will be MPG. BeautifulSoup and Selenium will be used to scrape and navigate the website. Pandas will be used to house and clean the scraped data, and data will be visualized using matplotlib and Seaborn. The minimum viable product for this project will be pair plots showing the relationship between captured features and the target, as well as linear regression models showing a thoughtful analysis of features to be used or omitted. As a plan B I will be conducting an analysis of movie data with a target yet to be determined.
